        "original_solution": "This problem has more than one solution. One is easily scalable to a higher number of coins by using base-three numbering: labelling each coin with a different number of three digits in base three, and positioning at the n-th weighing all the coins that are labelled with the n-th digit identical to the label of the plate (with three plates, one on each side of the scale labelled 0 and 2, and one off the scale labelled 1).[4] Other step-by-step procedures are similar to the following. It is less straightforward for this problem, and the second and third weighings depend on what has happened previously, although that need not be the case (see below).\n\nFour coins are put on each side. There are two possibilities:\n1. One side is heavier than the other. If this is the case, remove three coins from the heavier side, move three coins from the lighter side to the heavier side, and place three coins that were not weighed the first time on the lighter side. (Remember which coins are which.) There are three possibilities:\n1.a) The same side that was heavier the first time is still heavier. This means that either the coin that stayed there is heavier or that the coin that stayed on the lighter side is lighter. Balancing one of these against one of the other ten coins reveals which of these is true, thus solving the puzzle.\n1.b) The side that was heavier the first time is lighter the second time. This means that one of the three coins that went from the lighter side to the heavier side is the light coin. For the third attempt, weigh two of these coins against each other: if one is lighter, it is the unique coin; if they balance, the third coin is the light one.\n1.c) Both sides are even. This means that one of the three coins that was removed from the heavier side is the heavy coin. For the third attempt, weigh two of these coins against each other: if one is heavier, it is the unique coin; if they balance, the third coin is the heavy one.\n2. Both sides are even. If this is the case, all eight coins are identical and can be set aside. Take the four remaining coins and place three on one side of the balance. Place 3 of the 8 identical coins on the other side. There are three possibilities:\n2.a) The three remaining coins are lighter. In this case you now know that one of those three coins is the odd one out and that it is lighter. Take two of those three coins and weigh them against each other. If the balance tips then the lighter coin is the odd one out. If the two coins balance then the third coin not on the balance is the odd one out and it is lighter.\n2.b) The three remaining coins are heavier. In this case you now know that one of those three coins is the odd one out and that it is heavier. Take two of those three coins and weigh them against each other. If the balance tips then the heavier coin is the odd one out. If the two coins balance then the third coin not on the balance is the odd one out and it is heavier.\n2.c) The three remaining coins balance. In this case you just need to weigh the remaining coin against any of the other 11 coins and this tells you whether it is heavier, lighter, or the same.",

Since we have 3000 bananas to transport.\nThe same way from IP1 to IP2 camel has to take a total of 3 trips, 2 forward and 1 backward. Since we have 2000 bananas to transport.\nAt last from IP2 to a destination only 1 forward move.\nLet's see the total number of bananas consumed at every point.\n\nFrom the source to IP1 its 5x bananas, as the distance between the source and IP1 is x km and the camel had 5 trips.\nFrom IP1 to IP2 its 3y bananas, as the distance between IP1 and IP2 is y km and the camel had 3 trips.\nFrom IP2 to destination its z bananas.\nWe now try to calculate the distance between the points:\n\n3000 - 5x = 2000 so we get x = 200\n2000-3y = 1000 so we get y = 333.33 but here the distance is also the number of bananas and it cannot be fraction so we take y =333 and at IP2 we have the number of bananas equal 1001, so its 2000-3y = 1001\nSo the remaining distance to the market is 1000 -x-y =z i.e  1000-200-333 => z =467.\nNow, there are 1001 bananas at IP2. However the camel can carry only 1000 bananas at a time, so we need to leave one banana behind.\n\nSo from IP2 to the destination point camel eats 467 bananas.

His vote (50%) is enough to ensure the deal.\n\n3 Pirates: Colin splits the coins 99 : 0 : 1. Eddie will accept this deal (getting just 1 coin), because he knows that if he rejects the deal there will be only two pirates left, and he gets nothing.\n\n4 Pirates: Billy splits the coins 99 : 0 : 1 : 0. By the same reasoning as before, Duncan will support this deal. Billy would not waste a spare coin on Colin, because Colin knows that if he rejects the proposal, he will pocket 99 coins once Billy is thrown overboard. Billy would also not give a coin to Eddie, because Eddie knows that if he rejects the proposal, he will receive a coin from Colin in the next round anyway.\n\n5 Pirates: Alex splits the coins 98 : 0 : 1 : 0 : 1.

Likewise, Alex would not give a coin to Duncan, because Duncan knows that if he votes against the proposal, Alex will be voted overboard and Billy will propose to offer Duncan the same single coin as Alex.

        "original_solution": "Let $L$ be the initial length of the rope, which is 1 meter, or 100 cm. Let $v$ be the speed of the ant, which is 1 cm/s.\nLet $L_n$ be the length of the rope after $n$ seconds. Since the rope stretches by 1 meter (100 cm) each second, the length of the rope at time $n$ seconds is $L_n = L + nL = L(1+n) = 100(1+n)$ cm.\n\nLet $d_n$ be the distance the ant has crawled after $n$ seconds. At each second, the ant covers 1 cm of the rope.\nLet $p_n$ be the fraction of the rope the ant has covered after $n$ seconds.\n$p_n = \\frac{\\text{total distance crawled}}{\\text{length of the rope}} = \\frac{d_n}{L_n} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{1+i}L}{L(1+n)} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{i}}{n+1} = \\frac{H_n}{n+1}$\nwhere $H_n$ is the $n^{th}$ harmonic number.\n\n$H_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k} \\approx \\ln n + \\gamma$ for large $n$, where $\\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.\n$p_n = \\frac{H_n}{n+1} \\approx \\frac{\\ln n + \\gamma}{n+1}$.\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln n}{n+1} = 0$ and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\gamma}{n+1} = 0$. So $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} p_n = 0$.\nHowever, the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}$ diverges, so the harmonic series $H_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k}$ also diverges as $n \\to \\infty$.\nConsider the fraction covered by the ant after $n$ seconds:\n$p_n = \\frac{H_n}{n+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{i(n+1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{i} - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{i}{i(i+1)}$\nThe fraction of the rope covered by the ant can be represented as the sum of the fractions of the rope covered in each second.\nLet $f_n$ be the fraction of the rope crawled in the $n$-th second.\n$f_n = \\frac{1}{100(n+1)}$.\nThe total fraction of the rope crawled by the ant is $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{100(n+1)} = \\frac{1}{100} \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}$, which diverges.

        "original_solution": "\"This is the classic \u201ctwo envelopes\u201d paradox. A na\u00efve calculation seems to show that you can gain by switching, but in fact there is no advantage either way. Here is why:\n\n1. Setup of the paradox:  \n   \u2022 There are two envelopes, one with X dollars and one with 2X dollars.  \n   \u2022 You pick an envelope at random, open it, and see an amount A.  \n   \u2022 You wonder, \u201cIs A the smaller amount or the larger amount?\u201d  \n\n2. The flawed \u201cna\u00efve\u201d argument:  \n   \u2022 You think: \u201cThere\u2019s a 50% chance this A is the smaller amount (so the other envelope would have 2A), and a 50% chance it\u2019s the larger amount (so the other envelope would have A/2).\u201d  \n   \u2022 Based on that, you compute the \u2018expected value\u2019 of switching to be:  \n       (1/2) \u00d7 (2A) + (1/2) \u00d7 (A/2) = A + A/4 = 1.25A,  \n     which is greater than A (the amount you currently hold).  \n\n3. Where the paradox arises:  \n   \u2022 That \u201c50\u201350 split\u201d between having the smaller and the larger amount is not necessarily correct once you have observed A.  \n   \u2022 The calculation implicitly assumes that \u201cA\u201d can equally likely be the smaller or larger half without carefully specifying any probability distribution for the original amounts.  \n\n4. Correct reasoning:  \n   \u2022 Without additional information about X (the smaller amount), there is no basis to prefer one envelope over the other after you see A.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cexpected gain\u201d argument cancels out once you acknowledge that seeing a specific amount A does not let you assign a simple 50\u201350 chance for \u201cA is X\u201d versus \u201cA is 2X.\u201d  \n\nConclusion:  \nIn general, there is no advantage to switching solely based on seeing the amount. If you have no extra information (e.g., about the possible range or distribution of X), your expected value is the same whether you switch or not. The apparent paradox appears only because of the flawed assumption about the probabilities after opening the first envelope.\"",

A fundamental fact from graph theory (Eulerian paths) is that a path that uses every edge exactly once can exist only if the graph has at most two vertices of odd degree. \n\nSince a cube graph has 8 vertices of odd degree, it is impossible to walk every edge precisely once in a single continuous route.

        "unpuzzle_solution": "A succinct way to see why the answer is \u201cyes\u201d (provided you allow yourself to step across faces) is to use the standard parity argument from graph theory:\n\n1) Think of the cube\u2019s edges and vertices as a graph. The cube has 8 vertices, each of degree 3.  \n2) A trail that uses every edge exactly once (an Eulerian trail) can exist only if the underlying graph has exactly 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. But here, all 8 vertices have odd degree (3).  \n3) However, each time you \u201ccross a face\u201d (i.e., move from one vertex to another without using an edge), you effectively change the parity of those two vertices:  \n   \u2013 From the point of view of the edges, \u201cleaving\u201d one vertex and \u201carriving\u201d at the other vertex without using an edge toggles each of their degrees (in the sense of how many edges you use to enter or leave that vertex).  \n4) Since you start with 8 odd\u2010degree vertices and you need exactly 2 to remain odd, you must toggle 6 vertices from odd to even. Each \u201cface crossing\u201d toggles 2 vertices, so you need exactly 3 such crossings.  \n\nAfter those three crossings (placed appropriately in your route), the resulting walk along the cube\u2019s edges has exactly two vertices of odd degree, permitting you to traverse every edge exactly once in one continuous walk. Visually, someone inspecting only the chalked edges will see that each edge was used exactly once; the off\u2010edge \u201cface crossings\u201d leave no visible trail.",

However, if someone has just fired and survived then we have eliminated the first scenario, B-----, it definitely wasn't that. And we are on the second chamber. We have essentially reduced the game to the following (removing the first row, because it wasn't that, and the first column because that chamber has been fired.):\n2 B----\n3 -B---\n4 --B--\n5 ---B-\n6 ----B\nWhich is just the same as a standard game of Russian Roulette if there were only 5 chambers in the gun. A 1 in 5 chance of dying is worse than a 1 in 6. So in the case of one bullet it would be in your interest to spin and re-randomise the gun.\n\nBack to Two Bullets\nWe will apply the same technique as above but first I would like to explain it intuitively. There's more than a hint of the game battleships here. As the second player we can only be hit by the second bullet in the chamber, remember they are consecutive, if the first bullet has already been fired, and we know it has not. By not spinning we have essentially removed an entire bullet from our problem. That is why we should fire the gun as is. Now lets model it.\n\nIf we randomise the gun we have a 2 in 6 or 1 in 3 chance of dying. The possible set ups at the start of the game are as follows:\n1 BB----\n2 -BB---\n3 --BB--\n4 ---BB-\n5 ----BB\n6 B----B\nAs player 1 didn't die we know it was not scenarios 1 and 6, eliminating those rows, and the first column as that chamber is no longer in the game - we're left with this:\n2 BB---\n3 -BB--\n4 --BB-\n5 ---BB\nGiving us a 1 in 4 chance of dying. By re spinning the gun it would have been 1 in 3. So in the case of 2 consecutive bullets it would not be in your interests to re-spin the chamber.\nAssumptions\nA fundamental assumption is that your objective is to survive the game. After that we're down to the usual, that the gun is randomised and not influenced by the weight of the bullets. The gun never gets jammed, you never miss. All very reasonable perhaps so implicit that you wouldn't think to mention them.\n\n",

Assuming that one person drinks water and one owns a zebra, then it is possible not only to deduce the answers to the two questions, but to figure out a complete solution of who lives where, in what color house, keeping what pet, drinking what drink, and smoking what brand of cigarettes. By considering the clues a few at a time, it is possible to slowly build inferences that incrementally complete the puzzle's unique correct solution. For example, the Norwegian lives in house #1, and house #2 must be blue. The Norwegian's house therefore cannot be blue, nor can it be red, where the Englishman lives, or green or ivory, which are next to each other.

First, consider the case when the cat started in an even numbered box, i.e., 2 or 4. On day 1, check box numbered 2. If you find the cat, you win. Otherwise, the cat must have been in box numbered 4 (considering only for even number case). So, next day the cat will move to either box numbered 3 or 5. On day 2, check box numbered 3. If you find the cat, you win. Otherwise, the cat must have moved to box numbered 5 and which means the cat can now only move to box numbered 4 on the next day. So, now we check box numbered 4 and we will certainly find the cat! Now, let's consider the case when the cat started in an odd numbered box, i.e., 1, 3 or 5. Following the previous strategy, till day 4 cat would be in either box numbered 2 or 4 because: On day 1, cat is in an odd numbered box 1 or 3 or 5.

The rose had done three complete twists and the jasmine had made five before they reached the tree\u2019s first branch. How many times do they cross, excluding the bottom and top?",
        "original_solution": "The first thing to realise is the vertical aspect of the puzzle is something of an illusion. For convenience we will proceed as if they both travel vertically at the same speed and thus complete the journey in the same unspecified time Ttotal, but this is for convenience regardless of the times the path described is the same.\n\nFrom here we may now consider their motion as being constrained to the outer edge of a circle in the horizontal plane. The problem now becomes not dissimilar to a puzzle involving the overlap of the hands of a clock, though of course the hands are moving in opposite directions.\n\nEach of the creepers will have speeds 5w and 3w. Where 'w' is some unspecified angular velocity in degrees per second, although the units are arbitrary. Using speed is distance over time or time = distance / speed, knowing that the total distance travelled 360 degrees times 5 revolutions or 3 revolutions we can easily show Ttotal as a function of w. Ttotal = 360 * 5 / (5w) or Ttotal = 360 * 3 / (3w) hence Ttotal = 360 / w. We will need this later.\n\nThe First Coincidence\nWe now have two motions around a circle starting at one point, travelling in opposite directions, with speeds 3w and 5w. We need to solve this for time.\n\nWe know a total distance of 360 degrees is travelled by two objects with speeds 5w and 3w. Our equations of motion give us:\n\n360=5wt + 3wt = 8wt\nt = 360 / 8w\n\nSo our first overlap is at t = 360 / 8w. In terms of subsequent overlaps the puzzle is in some ways reset. They are co-existent at this time and travelling in opposite directions. if we were to calculate the next time of overlap it would be the same. We now know an overlap occurs every 360 / 8w\nTotal Coincidence\nAn overlap occurs every 360 / 8w for a time of Ttotal = 360 / w hence the number of coincidence is\n\n:Ttotal / time between coincidence\n:(360 / w) / (360 / 8w)\n:8\n\nsince the division is exact we know that the last coincidence is at t = Ttotal, hence there are 7 overlaps not including the top and bottom.",

        "unpuzzle_solution": "A convenient way to see why the creepers cross exactly once is to \u201cunwrap\u201d the cylindrical trunk into a rectangle. Label the vertical direction by z going from 0 (the bottom) to 1 (the top), and label the horizontal direction by the angle \u03b8 going around the trunk from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n\u2022 If the rose creeper makes one complete (clockwise) revolution as z goes from 0 to 1, its path on the rectangle can be parameterized by:  \n  \u03b8(rose) = 2\u03c0z,    0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.\n\n\u2022 If the jasmine creeper makes one complete (counterclockwise) revolution, its path on the rectangle can be parameterized by:  \n  \u03b8(jasmine) = \u22122\u03c0z,    0 \u2264 z \u2264 1.\n\nFor the two creepers to cross (i.e., occupy the same point on the cylinder), they must have the same z-value and the same angle (modulo 2\u03c0). Mathematically, this means:\n\n  2\u03c0z = \u22122\u03c0z + 2\u03c0k for some integer k,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n  4\u03c0z = 2\u03c0k  \u21d2  z = k/2.\n\nSince z must be between 0 and 1 (excluding the bottom z = 0 and the top z = 1), the only possible integer k that fits is k = 1, giving z = 1/2. This corresponds to exactly one interior crossing. \n\nTherefore, the creepers cross exactly once between the bottom and the top.",

        "original_puzzle": "100 people standing in a circle in an order 1 to 100. No. 1 has a sword. He kills the next person (i.e. No. 2) and gives the sword to the next (i.e. No. 3). All people do the same until only 1 survives. Which number survives?",
        "original_solution": "This is the classic Josephus problem.  A simple way to solve it for powers of 2 is to notice that if you have 2<sup>n</sup> people, person 1 survives.  That's because in the first round, all the even-numbered people are eliminated, leaving the odd-numbered people.  Then person 1 eliminates person 3, person 5 eliminates person 7, and so on. This pattern continues until only person 1 remains.\n\nSince 100 is not a power of 2, we find the nearest power of 2 less than 100, which is 64 (2<sup>6</sup>).  When 64 people are eliminated, 36 will remain.  Number 73 will have the sword.  The remaining people are 73, 74, ..., 100 (28 people), and 1, 2, ..., 36 (36 people). This gives a total of 64.\n\nWe can then renumber the survivors from 1 to 64. The person holding the sword is number 73, which translates to number 73 - 36 = 37 in the new numbering from 1 to 64.\n\nIf there were 64, the survivor would be #1.  Since we have 37 which translates to 37 * 2 - 1 = 73 for 100.\n\nFor 100 people, we can represent 100 in binary as 1100100.  Shift the leftmost digit to the right end to get 1001001.  Convert this back to decimal: 64 + 8 + 1 = 73.\n\nMy final answer is: 73",

One of them fuels up the other one and goes back to the first leg, where it meets the third plane which comes from the start to supply it with 1/3 fuel so they can both can return to the start. In the meantime, the other plane at the second leg having a full tank flies to the 5th leg. One (of the two) plane from the start can now go to the 5th leg (which is only one leg away the opposite direction), share its remaining fuel and both planes return safely to the start.",

Now take the ball out of the toy boat and drop it into the pool, and measure the water's level again. Will the water level with the ball dropped in the pool be higher?",

When the ball is in the water, in only displaces as much water as the volume of the ball. Since lead is denser than water, the amount of water equal in weight to the ball is greater than the amount of water equal in volume to the ball; hence, the water level is higher.",

When you measure the water level the second time, the volume will have risen by the volume of the ball plus the water needed to keep the boat floating.
