        "original_puzzle": "You have 12 coins, and one is counterfeit, being either heavier or lighter than the others. You have a balance scale. What's the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the counterfeit coin? ",
        "original_solution": "This problem has more than one solution. One is easily scalable to a higher number of coins by using base-three numbering: labelling each coin with a different number of three digits in base three, and positioning at the n-th weighing all the coins that are labelled with the n-th digit identical to the label of the plate (with three plates, one on each side of the scale labelled 0 and 2, and one off the scale labelled 1).[4] Other step-by-step procedures are similar to the following. It is less straightforward for this problem, and the second and third weighings depend on what has happened previously, although that need not be the case (see below).\n\nFour coins are put on each side. There are two possibilities:\n1. One side is heavier than the other. If this is the case, remove three coins from the heavier side, move three coins from the lighter side to the heavier side, and place three coins that were not weighed the first time on the lighter side. (Remember which coins are which.) There are three possibilities:\n1.a) The same side that was heavier the first time is still heavier. This means that either the coin that stayed there is heavier or that the coin that stayed on the lighter side is lighter. Balancing one of these against one of the other ten coins reveals which of these is true, thus solving the puzzle.\n1.b) The side that was heavier the first time is lighter the second time. This means that one of the three coins that went from the lighter side to the heavier side is the light coin. For the third attempt, weigh two of these coins against each other: if one is lighter, it is the unique coin; if they balance, the third coin is the light one.\n1.c) Both sides are even. This means that one of the three coins that was removed from the heavier side is the heavy coin. For the third attempt, weigh two of these coins against each other: if one is heavier, it is the unique coin; if they balance, the third coin is the heavy one.\n2. Both sides are even. If this is the case, all eight coins are identical and can be set aside. Take the four remaining coins and place three on one side of the balance. Place 3 of the 8 identical coins on the other side. There are three possibilities:\n2.a) The three remaining coins are lighter. In this case you now know that one of those three coins is the odd one out and that it is lighter. Take two of those three coins and weigh them against each other. If the balance tips then the lighter coin is the odd one out. If the two coins balance then the third coin not on the balance is the odd one out and it is lighter.\n2.b) The three remaining coins are heavier. In this case you now know that one of those three coins is the odd one out and that it is heavier. Take two of those three coins and weigh them against each other. If the balance tips then the heavier coin is the odd one out. If the two coins balance then the third coin not on the balance is the odd one out and it is heavier.\n2.c) The three remaining coins balance. In this case you just need to weigh the remaining coin against any of the other 11 coins and this tells you whether it is heavier, lighter, or the same.",

Since we have 3000 bananas to transport.\nThe same way from IP1 to IP2 camel has to take a total of 3 trips, 2 forward and 1 backward. Since we have 2000 bananas to transport.\nAt last from IP2 to a destination only 1 forward move.\nLet's see the total number of bananas consumed at every point.\n\nFrom the source to IP1 its 5x bananas, as the distance between the source and IP1 is x km and the camel had 5 trips.\nFrom IP1 to IP2 its 3y bananas, as the distance between IP1 and IP2 is y km and the camel had 3 trips.\nFrom IP2 to destination its z bananas.\nWe now try to calculate the distance between the points:\n\n3000 - 5x = 2000 so we get x = 200\n2000-3y = 1000 so we get y = 333.33 but here the distance is also the number of bananas and it cannot be fraction so we take y =333 and at IP2 we have the number of bananas equal 1001, so its 2000-3y = 1001\nSo the remaining distance to the market is 1000 -x-y =z i.e  1000-200-333 => z =467.\nNow, there are 1001 bananas at IP2. However the camel can carry only 1000 bananas at a time, so we need to leave one banana behind.\n\nSo from IP2 to the destination point camel eats 467 bananas.

Billy would not waste a spare coin on Colin, because Colin knows that if he rejects the proposal, he will pocket 99 coins once Billy is thrown overboard.

Likewise, Alex would not give a coin to Duncan, because Duncan knows that if he votes against the proposal, Alex will be voted overboard and Billy will propose to offer Duncan the same single coin as Alex.

        "original_puzzle": "You are given two envelopes, each containing a sum of money. One envelope contains twice as much money as the other. You pick one envelope at random and see the amount inside. You are then given the option to switch envelopes. Should you switch, and why?",
        "original_solution": "\"This is the classic \u201ctwo envelopes\u201d paradox. A na\u00efve calculation seems to show that you can gain by switching, but in fact there is no advantage either way. Here is why:\n\n1. Setup of the paradox:  \n   \u2022 There are two envelopes, one with X dollars and one with 2X dollars.  \n   \u2022 You pick an envelope at random, open it, and see an amount A.  \n   \u2022 You wonder, \u201cIs A the smaller amount or the larger amount?\u201d  \n\n2. The flawed \u201cna\u00efve\u201d argument:  \n   \u2022 You think: \u201cThere\u2019s a 50% chance this A is the smaller amount (so the other envelope would have 2A), and a 50% chance it\u2019s the larger amount (so the other envelope would have A/2).\u201d  \n   \u2022 Based on that, you compute the \u2018expected value\u2019 of switching to be:  \n       (1/2) \u00d7 (2A) + (1/2) \u00d7 (A/2) = A + A/4 = 1.25A,  \n     which is greater than A (the amount you currently hold).  \n\n3. Where the paradox arises:  \n   \u2022 That \u201c50\u201350 split\u201d between having the smaller and the larger amount is not necessarily correct once you have observed A.  \n   \u2022 The calculation implicitly assumes that \u201cA\u201d can equally likely be the smaller or larger half without carefully specifying any probability distribution for the original amounts.  \n\n4. Correct reasoning:  \n   \u2022 Without additional information about X (the smaller amount), there is no basis to prefer one envelope over the other after you see A.  \n   \u2022 The \u201cexpected gain\u201d argument cancels out once you acknowledge that seeing a specific amount A does not let you assign a simple 50\u201350 chance for \u201cA is X\u201d versus \u201cA is 2X.\u201d  \n\nConclusion:  \nIn general, there is no advantage to switching solely based on seeing the amount. If you have no extra information (e.g., about the possible range or distribution of X), your expected value is the same whether you switch or not. The apparent paradox appears only because of the flawed assumption about the probabilities after opening the first envelope.\"",

        "original_solution": "First, we group the horses into groups of 5 and race each group on the race course. This gives us 5 races (see image below).  Imagine a table with five rows and six columns, each row represents one race of 5 horses. For convenience, let us name the horses using the row and column index. Therefore, the first race(row 1) was contested between the horses R1C1, R1C2, R1C3, R1C4 and R1C5. The second race (row 2) was contested between the horses R2C1, R2C2 and so on. Let us assume that the fifth member of each row won the race (R1C5 won the first race, R2C5 won the second race and so on), the fourth member of each row came second (R1C4 came second in the first race, R2C4 came second in the second race and so on) and the third member of each group came third (R1C3 came third in the first race, R2C3 came third in the second race and so on). \n\nNext, we race the 5 level 1 winners (R1C5, R2C5, R3C5, R4C5 and R5C5). Let's say R1C5 wins this race, R2C5 comes second and R3C5 comes third. The winner of this race (R1C5) is the fastest horse of the entire group. Now, the horse which is second in the entire group can either be R2C5 or R1C4. The horse which is third in the entire group can either be R3C5, R2C4 or R1C3. Therefore, we race these 5 horses. Therefore, the horse R1C5 is the fastest horse. The horses which come first and second in the last race are the horses which are second and third in the entire group respectively. in this way, the minimum number of races required to determine the first, second and third horses in the entire group is 7. \n ",

If we then example the remaining 4 couples and ignore the hand shaking with the first couple, we can conclude that the person who shook 7 hands and 1 hand are also married. By incuction, this means that 0 and 8, 7 and 1, 6 and 2, 5 and 3 are married. The last couple both shook 4 people's hands.

For convenience we will proceed as if they both travel vertically at the same speed and thus complete the journey in the same unspecified time Ttotal, but this is for convenience regardless of the times the path described is the same.\n\nFrom here we may now consider their motion as being constrained to the outer edge of a circle in the horizontal plane. The problem now becomes not dissimilar to a puzzle involving the overlap of the hands of a clock, though of course the hands are moving in opposite directions.\n\nEach of the creepers will have speeds 5w and 3w. Where 'w' is some unspecified angular velocity in degrees per second, although the units are arbitrary. Using speed is distance over time or time = distance / speed, knowing that the total distance travelled 360 degrees times 5 revolutions or 3 revolutions we can easily show Ttotal as a function of w. Ttotal = 360 * 5 / (5w) or Ttotal = 360 * 3 / (3w) hence Ttotal = 360 / w. We will need this later.\n\nThe First Coincidence\nWe now have two motions around a circle starting at one point, travelling in opposite directions, with speeds 3w and 5w. We need to solve this for time.\n\nWe know a total distance of 360 degrees is travelled by two objects with speeds 5w and 3w. Our equations of motion give us:\n\n360=5wt + 3wt = 8wt\nt = 360 / 8w\n\nSo our first overlap is at t = 360 / 8w. In terms of subsequent overlaps the puzzle is in some ways reset. They are co-existent at this time and travelling in opposite directions. if we were to calculate the next time of overlap it would be the same. We now know an overlap occurs every 360 / 8w\nTotal Coincidence\nAn overlap occurs every 360 / 8w for a time of Ttotal = 360 / w hence the number of coincidence is\n\n:Ttotal / time between coincidence\n:(360 / w) / (360 / 8w)\n:8\n\nsince the division is exact we know that the last coincidence is at t = Ttotal, hence there are 7 overlaps not including the top and bottom.",

Mathematically, this means:\n\n  2\u03c0z = \u22122\u03c0z + 2\u03c0k for some integer k,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n  4\u03c0z = 2\u03c0k  \u21d2  z = k/2.\n\nSince z must be between 0 and 1 (excluding the bottom z = 0 and the top z = 1), the only possible integer k that fits is k = 1, giving z = 1/2.

        "original_solution": "We can think of each path as a sequence of moves.  Since we have to move 5 steps down and 5 steps right (a total of 10 steps), each path is a sequence of 10 moves, where 5 are \"\"down\"\" (D) and 5 are \"\"right\"\" (R).  \n\nThe number of ways to arrange these moves is equivalent to the number of ways to choose which 5 of the 10 moves are \"\"down\"\" (the others must be \"\"right\"\").  This is a combination problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 5 \"\"down\"\" moves out of 10 total moves is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nIn our case, n = 10 (total moves) and k = 5 (\"\"down\"\" moves):\n\nC(10, 5) = 10! / (5! * 5!) = (10*9*8*7*6) / (5*4*3*2*1) = 252",

        "original_solution": "This is the classic Josephus problem.  A simple way to solve it for powers of 2 is to notice that if you have 2<sup>n</sup> people, person 1 survives.  That's because in the first round, all the even-numbered people are eliminated, leaving the odd-numbered people.  Then person 1 eliminates person 3, person 5 eliminates person 7, and so on. This pattern continues until only person 1 remains.\n\nSince 100 is not a power of 2, we find the nearest power of 2 less than 100, which is 64 (2<sup>6</sup>).  When 64 people are eliminated, 36 will remain.  Number 73 will have the sword.  The remaining people are 73, 74, ..., 100 (28 people), and 1, 2, ..., 36 (36 people). This gives a total of 64.\n\nWe can then renumber the survivors from 1 to 64. The person holding the sword is number 73, which translates to number 73 - 36 = 37 in the new numbering from 1 to 64.\n\nIf there were 64, the survivor would be #1.  Since we have 37 which translates to 37 * 2 - 1 = 73 for 100.\n\nFor 100 people, we can represent 100 in binary as 1100100.  Shift the leftmost digit to the right end to get 1001001.  Convert this back to decimal: 64 + 8 + 1 = 73.\n\nMy final answer is: 73",
